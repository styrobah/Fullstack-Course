CSS Positioning Explained

CSS positioning determines how elements are placed on a webpage. There
are five main position values:

1. static (default)

Behavior: Elements are placed in the normal document flow.
When to use: Most elements by default.

Example:

position: static;

2. relative

Behavior: Positions element relative to its original position.
You can use top, left, right, bottom to shift it without affecting
surrounding elementsâ€™ flow.

Example:

position: relative; top: 10px; left: 20px;

3. absolute

Behavior: Positions element relative to the nearest positioned ancestor
(anything with position other than static). Removed from the normal
flow, so it can overlap other elements.

Example:

position: absolute; top: 0; right: 0;

4. fixed

Behavior: Positions element relative to the viewport (browser window).
Stays in place even when scrolling.

Example:

position: fixed; bottom: 0; right: 0;

5. sticky

Behavior: Acts like relative until a certain scroll position is reached,
then acts like fixed. Useful for sticky headers or menus.

Example:

position: sticky; top: 0;
