CSS Float Explained

The float property in CSS is used to position an element to the left or right of its container, allowing text and inline elements to wrap around it.

float: left

Positions the element on the left side of its container.

Other inline content flows on the right side.

float: left;

float: right

Positions the element on the right side of its container.

Other inline content flows on the left side.

float: right;

float: none (default)

The element does not float; it remains in normal flow.

float: none;

float: inline-start / inline-end

Positions relative to the writing mode of the document (useful for right-to-left languages).

float: inline-start; /* start side of text flow */
float: inline-end;   /* end side of text flow */

Clearing Floats

When using floats, following content can wrap around them unintentionally. To stop that, use the clear property.

clear values:

left — no content allowed on left side.

right — no content allowed on right side.

both — no content allowed on either side.

clear: both;

Common Use Cases

Wrapping text around images.

Creating basic multi-column layouts (older technique, replaced by flexbox/grid).
